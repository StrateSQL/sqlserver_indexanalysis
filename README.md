# SQL Server Index Analysis

This repository provides a stored procedure for analyzing SQL Server indexes, offering insights into potential optimizations, such as creating, modifying, or dropping indexes. The recommendations are intended as guidelines and should be adapted based on your knowledge and experience with the database.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Recommendations in the **Index Action** column are not definitive but serve as starting points for further analysis. Always apply your expertise and knowledge of the database before making changes.
- DMV (Dynamic Management Views) data is reset:
  - When the SQL Server service restarts.
  - When the database is brought online.
  - When index metadata is updated, such as during reindex operations.
- Index statistics in `sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats` and `sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats` are cleared when an index is rebuilt.
- Missing index statistics in the `sys.dm_db_missing_index_*` DMVs are reset whenever a new index is created on a table.
- Names in the **Index Name** column for non-existent indexes are placeholders, not recommended names.

## üí° Index Action Recommendations
- **CREATE**: Add a new index to improve performance.
- **DROP-DUP**: Remove duplicate indexes.
- **DROP-USAGE**: Remove indexes with low usage or high cost.
- **BLEND**: Merge missing index details into an existing index.
- **REALIGN**: Adjust clustered indexes or include additional columns.

## üìú Example Usage
```sql
EXEC dbo.IndexAnalysis 
    @TableName = 'MyTable',
    @IncludeMissingIndexes = 1,
    @Output = 'DETAILED';
